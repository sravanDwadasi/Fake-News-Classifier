About the Dataset:

1. id: unique id for a news article
2. title: the title of a news article
3. author: author of the news article
4. text: the text of the article; could be incomplete
5. label: a label that marks whether the news article is real or fake:
           1: Fake news
           0: real News

We have developed a fake news detection system using various libraries and inbuilt functions like NLTP in Python and used processes like stemming and vectorization for the data reduction processes. The project processes the news taken as input and classifier whether it is a Real one or a fake one. Implemented these model in various Machine learning classification algorithms like 
1. SVM, 
2. KNN, 
3. Logistic Regression and 
4. Decision Tree classifiers.
